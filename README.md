Pandas is a popular Python library used for data manipulation and analysis. It is particularly useful for handling and transforming tabular data (i.e., data that is structured in rows and columns). Pandas provides tools for reading and writing data from a variety of sources, including CSV, Excel, SQL databases, and more. It also offers powerful features for data cleaning, filtering, and transformation, as well as for merging, grouping, and aggregating data.

Whether you are working with small or large datasets, Pandas can help you to efficiently explore and analyze your data. In this ReadMe file, we will provide a brief introduction to some of the key concepts and functions in Pandas that you need to know to get started. By the end of this guide, you should have a basic understanding of how to load data into a Pandas DataFrame, manipulate and transform the data, and perform basic data analysis tasks.

When you fork your repository, they create your own copy of it on GitHub that you can modify and experiment with as you please. This allows you to work independently without affecting the original codebase. You can also submit **pull requests** to suggest changes or improvements to the code, which I can then review and merge into the repository if I choose.

## Navigate to the repository you want to fork on GitHub.

Click on the "Fork" button located at the top right corner of the page. This will create a copy of the repository in your own GitHub account.

Once the fork is complete, you will be taken to the forked repository page on GitHub. You will notice that the repository now belongs to your GitHub account, and the URL of the repository will have your GitHub username in it.

If you want to make changes to the code in the forked repository, you can clone it to your local machine. To do this, click on the "Code" button located on the right side of the page.

You will see a drop-down menu with options for cloning the repository. You can choose to clone the repository using HTTPS or SSH, depending on your preference. Click on the option you prefer, and copy the URL provided.

Open up your preferred terminal or command prompt on your local machine and navigate to the directory where you want to clone the repository.

Type git clone, followed by the URL you copied in step 5, and hit enter. This will download a copy of the repository to your local machine.

You can now open the cloned repository in your preferred code editor, make changes to the code, and commit those changes back to the repository.

Once you've made changes to the code and committed them, you can create a pull request to suggest the changes to the original repository owner.
