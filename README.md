Pandas is a popular Python library used for data manipulation and analysis. It is particularly useful for handling and transforming tabular data (i.e., data that is structured in rows and columns). Pandas provides tools for reading and writing data from a variety of sources, including CSV, Excel, SQL databases, and more. It also offers powerful features for data cleaning, filtering, and transformation, as well as for merging, grouping, and aggregating data.

Whether you are working with small or large datasets, Pandas can help you to efficiently explore and analyze your data. In this ReadMe file, we will provide a brief introduction to some of the key concepts and functions in Pandas that you need to know to get started. By the end of this guide, you should have a basic understanding of how to load data into a Pandas DataFrame, manipulate and transform the data, and perform basic data analysis tasks.
